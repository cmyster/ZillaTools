1. Maybe get a whole dumpload of everything, create a DB locally and parse
   there.
2. Each call needs to running in its own handler, and moved to its own
   tread.
3. Line by line is pointless when going over all the DFGs, it takes time
   and the output is too long. Comma delimited is probably better.
